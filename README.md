Trying out styles with the Bulma Framework

I set out to learn CSS frameworks other than Bootstrap. I found that the ability to quickly create layouts with Bulma made the callouts under "Services" much cleaner. I also found the navbar implementation a smooth process. 

Other than learning the framework, I used Gimp to process images and create transparent layers for the hero image in the top section. I also used it to clean up and transform the logo in the brand section of the navbar.
